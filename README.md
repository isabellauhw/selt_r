# selt_r
This repository contains the implementation of the SELT-R (Social Evaluation Learning Task â€“ Revised; Lau et al., 2024), a modified version of the original SELT task introduced in Button et al. (2023). This adaptation has been redesigned to broaden its applicability, particularly for use with children.
